# :vulcan_salute: Hi,

I'm a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/), a 42 Network programming school.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website to play pong with friends (TRANSCENDENCE)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - to board and ship projects more quickly
  - also, TypeScript and the web ecosystem
